The `typing.py` file documentation became quite large and obsidian
started having troubles rendering it.

`typing.py` is now a folder to help break up the documentation.

`typing` is the primary file and contains hyperlinks to its Type Aliases
where each type gets its own file. These files are prepended with `__`
because they are not directly their own entities within the
ManimCommunity resources
